 rogue-esque schmup
 
 Shoot em up inspired by traditional rogue-likes like NetHack. I need to figure out a way to make the grpahics 
 smoother. I'm building a string iteratively, and drawing it to an image, then displaying it. There's a lot going 
 on to make the string and its quite laggy. Happy to have something going though. 
 
 Trying to be as organized as possible with the code. Should probably split it up into different files.
